# Finger Paint
## About
Android Paint is a drawing application for Android. Features include:
* Multiple brush styles and a full palette of colors
* Undo/redo history
* Saving and sharing the artwork

Finger Paint is a fun project from early in my CS career.

## Contributing
Finger paint could use some updates, and I could use some help! Feel free to
fork and pull request. There are currently multiple versions offered, including
paid versions, and if this gains traction I will happily change to make all
features free for all.
